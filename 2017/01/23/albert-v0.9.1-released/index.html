<p>This release was intended to contain only fixes.
However there are some minor nifty changes recognizable by the user.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Although not planned to be made official you can scan your files by typing albert scan files. Note that this feature may disappear someday.</li>
  <li>You can choose the terminal command in the settings dialog. The list shows all installed terminals. If you like you can provide a custom command.</li>
  <li>The app icon now uses a theme icon.</li>
  <li>Items of the files extension have now an “Open terminal here” action.</li>
</ul>
