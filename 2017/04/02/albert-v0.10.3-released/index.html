<h1 id="albert-v0103-released">Albert v0.10.3 released</h1>

<p>This release contains the latest fixes.</p>

<p>Due to problems with the indexing (#419) the terminal extension changed. The extension does no more show suggestions, but a single item to run your command instead. Further the default action is now “Run in terminal”. However the “Run in shell” action is still available in the alternative actions.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.10.3">git log</a> for details.</p>
