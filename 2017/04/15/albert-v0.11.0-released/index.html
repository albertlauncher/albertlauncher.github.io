<h1 id="albert-v0110-released">Albert v0.11.0 released</h1>

<p>Albert v0.11.0 is all about the files extension. The new release finally allows a fine-grained control of the MIME types to be indexed by the files extension. In the settings of the files extension the <em>Advanced</em> button in the <em>Indexed MIME types</em> group box opens a dialog which allows the user to set wildcard patterns that are used to match against the MIME types of the indexed files. Hopefully this is a partial solution for <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/issues/1">#1</a> for some of you too.</p>

<p>Extensions can now have multiple triggers. An example of multiple triggers is the files extension: A prefix of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> triggers the files extension in browse mode.</p>

<p>The sorting algorithm is now stable. This means that items that are equal regarding their sorting order are now displayed in the order they were added to the results.</p>

<p>Based on this the browse mode now lists the results in lexicographical order with directories before the files.</p>

<p>Additionally the use of fallbacks have been disabled for triggered queries. The rationale behind this decision is that the user implicitly tells that he want something special, not a general fallback.</p>

<p>All of the changes above make the files browse mode extremely convenient and clutter free.</p>

<p>Further the websearch extension now contains an URL handler. Valid URLs are recognized as such if it contains a top- and second level domain, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">google.com</code>. The top level domain has to be one of the ones registered by the <a href="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least the qss property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">selection-color</code> works as expected now.</p>

<p>As always check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.11.0">git log</a> for details.</p>
