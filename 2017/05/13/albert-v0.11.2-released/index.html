<h1 id="albert-v0112-released">Albert v0.11.2 released</h1>

<p>This release contains the latest fixes. Further the following minor things changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The web searches can not be enabled/disabled anymore as fallbacks. There will be a more generic mechanism that is responsible for that.</li>
  <li>URLs starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code> skip the TLD validation. This way you can access e.g. host in the LAN.</li>
  <li>The files extension <strong>does not</strong> require at least three chars anymore. Make sure you set your file filters correctly.</li>
  <li><kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> now work for the results list holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.11.2">git log</a> for details.</p>
