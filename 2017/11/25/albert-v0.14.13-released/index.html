<h1 id="albert-v01413-released">Albert v0.14.13 released</h1>

<p>This release introduces rich text for item texts. Extensions using the offline index do not use it yet, since computing the matching substring is a bit more involved.</p>

<p>The TermAction now has a new option to set the behavior when the process exited. (Close, Close on success, Don not close).</p>

<p>This version ships with two new python extension: One interfacing the Arch User Repositories and another adapting scrot, a screenshot tool (credits go to Benedict Dudel).</p>

<p>As always the release also contains the latest fixes and minor improvements.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.13">git log</a> for details.</p>
