<h1 id="albert-v01419-released">Albert v0.14.19 released</h1>

<p>This release contains the latest fixes and two new Python extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Datetime. (Time display and conversion. Supersedes the external extension)</li>
  <li>Bitfinex. (Quickly access Bitfinex markets)</li>
</ul>

<p>The file browse mode finally mimics bash completion behavior.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.19">git log</a> for details.</p>

<p>Further I want to let you know that I will stop posting news on <a href="https://semver.org/">patch releases</a>.
Iâ€™ll try to move changes that are recognizeable by users into minor releases.
Note that there are no major releases at the moment since albert is still alpha.</p>
