<ul>
  <li>Let RPCServer take care of crash reports. This is a hotfix to remove the recurring crash report on start, if the app is run more than once, e.g. because the session manager restores a session including albert, but albert is also configured to be autostarted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.22.14">GitHub repositories</a> for details.</p>
