<h1>Extending Albert</h1>
<p>Albert has a flexible extension system, which provides users and developers with the ability to extend the functionality by creating <em>plugins</em>. These plugins can be used to provide several kinds of functionality by implementing particular interfaces. An instance of such an interface is called an <em>extension</em>. A plugin can provide several extensions.</p>

<p>Albert is written in C++ using the Qt framework. Since C++ knowledge is not that widespread and to make extension developers lifes easier, Albert can be extended in several ways.</p>

<p>The native and primary way is to use C++/Qt to write a QPlugin. This gives you the performance of C++, the full set of interfaces to implement, access to several utility classes and direct access to the application and Qt framework including the event loop, which allows asynchronous operations.

<p>A simple and extremely flexible way to extend Albert is to use executables. This makes writing plugins less complicated and accessible to a broader community, since <em>any</em> language that can be used to build executable files can be used. However this approach is expensive in resource consumption and has several restrictions. Read more in the article about <a href="/docs/extending/external/">external plugins</a>.</p>
