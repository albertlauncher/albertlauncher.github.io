<h1>Chromium extension</h1>
<p>The chromium/chrome extension makes your chromium/chrome bookmarks accessible via albert.</p>

<p>In the settings dialog you can set the path to your bookmarks file, if the default path is not correct. This may happen if you have multiple profiles in use. The fuzzy option allows error tolerant matching of the items.</p>
