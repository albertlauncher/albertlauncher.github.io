title: Files Extension

<h1>Files extension</h1>
<p>The files extension indexes the files in the given directory by their name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TODO be more specific</p>

<p>Further the files extension provides a way to browse through paths that are <em>not</em> indexed. Queries that begin with either <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/</code> are interpreted as a beginning of a path and the extension lists the files in this directory. In combination with the tab completions this is a nice way to browse the file system.</p>
