        <h1>Albert finally has a website</h1>
        <p>Until recently the information relevant to the user was cluttered over several places. For a motivation there was a small landing page on github-pages, the github repository had a README.md, which basically served the same purpose, to get help the user had to go to the wiki and for newsâ€¦ well there was nothing. Finally there is now a place where everything gets merged to a single website: The project website <em><a href="http://albertlauncher.github.io">albertlauncher.github.io</a>.</em></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and a handcrafted theme based on the <a href="https://milligram.github.io/">Milligram CSS framework</a> the static website offers a nice reading experience and is still somewhat maintainable for a lazy c++ guy. The docs are dynamically generated from markdown sources and allow Github users to send pull request for modifications, e.g. typos. News post are dynamically generated too and even build a RSS news feed to allow interested users to subscribe and be up to date.</p>
