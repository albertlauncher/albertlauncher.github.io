        <h1>Albert 0.10 released</h1>
        <p>Albert v0.10 introduces tab completion using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. This allows extensions to suggest a completion text for the input box. An example: You type 2+2 into the box. When you select the calculator item and press complete the equation in the input box resolves to the result 4. The alternative actions have moved to the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, which has to be hold to show the alternative actions. The default fallback is now on <kbd>Meta</kbd>.</p>

<p>Hovering over the input box the mouse wheel can now be used to browse the history, exactly the way you are used to it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+.</p>

<p>Further there is a new group of themes, the Spotlight themes, which come in three flavors: Bright, Dark and Space (Gray with Blue accent).</p>

<p>Albert v0.10 ships with two new extensions, <a href="/docs/extensions/mpris/">MPRIS</a> and a rudimentary <a href="/docs/extensions/ssh/">Secure Shell</a> extension. Check their documentation for more details.</p>

<p>The terminal extension now provides the shell aliases too.</p>

<p>Further the files extension provides now a way to browse through paths that are <em>not</em> indexed. Queries that begin with either <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/</code> are interpreted as a beginning of a path and the extension lists the files in this directory. In combination with the tab completions this is a nice way to browse the file system.</p>

<p>The application extension allows now to ignore the <code class="highlighter-rouge">OnlyShowIn</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NotShowIn</code> keys in the desktop entries.</p>

<p>For developers: The bash script to clone the template extension is now deprecated and replaced by a Python script.</p>
