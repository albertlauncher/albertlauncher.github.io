Beyond designing, developing, testing, and maintaining the core application and many plugins, actively or passively, I also handle packaging for almost all supported platforms. This alone is a complex task, given the combinations of distributions, architectures, and the inconsistent feature support in compilers and standard libraries. Ensuring that Albert builds everywhere is a major time sink. I place strong emphasis on providing plugin authors with an excellent developer experience. I design and continuously refine an API that is easy to understand, yet powerful and hard to break. Writing clear, structured, and unambiguous documentation is just as important, and just as time-consuming. A significant portion of the work happens in largely invisible areas: For example, achieving outstanding performance while minimizing battery usage, testing the latest language/toolkit features that eventually may end up unused, keeping the website up to date, and dealing with the flaws of the ever-changing environment Albert interfaces. As a result, I actively contribute to other projects by doing whatever is necessary to keep Albert running everywhere. Beyond the technical work, I also try to build and organize a vibrant community of users and contributors, and to provide user and developer support through community channels and GitHub whenever possible.

This means that only one thread can execute Python code at a time. This can become a problem for parallelization of queries or multithreaded global queries.

If you can, use IndexQueryHandler instead, which performs the handling in C++ space. | PyBind11 method resolution does not support mixin behavior. Usually this should not be much of a problem, but there is one prevalent use case: Reusing id, name and description of the PluginInstance class for your Extension.
